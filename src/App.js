/* using v6 of react router

“catch all” route that will be rendered if none of your other routes match -> 404 page.

Unlike previous versions of React Router, the order of the children Routes doesn’t matter since Routes is intelligent – meaning an algorithm now determines which is the best Route to render. This makes rendering a 404 component pretty simple.

All you have to do is render a Route with a path of *, and React Router will make sure to only render the element if none of the other Routes match.
